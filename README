Yeah, these are the comments found in the top of the plugin file :D

	This plugin makes creating maps from the Google API V3 easier with the help of jQuery. It implements 
 	the basic features of displaying a map along with the ability to retrieve directions. 

 	Requires jQuery (http://ajax.googleapis.com/ajax/libs/jquery/1.5.2/jquery.min.js)
	Requires the API to be loaded (http://maps.google.com/maps/api/js?sensor=set_to_true_or_false)

	Options:
		address: A text representation of an address (slower than passing lat/lon directly)

		latitude: The latitude to center the map on

		longitude: The longitude to center the map on 

   	width: The width to give the map 
			- defaults to the elements width

   	height: The height of the map
			- defaults to the elements height

   	zoom: Zoom level for the map (integer, default 13)
			- Higher number = closer zoom

   	mapType: The map type (default 'roadmap')
			- Types: roadmap | satellite | hybrid | terrain

   	marker: Whether a marker should be added or not (bool)

   	markerTitle: The title to apply to the marker (as a tooltip)

   	markerClick: Callback for when the marker is clicked

   	infoBubble: Whether or not to display the info bubble (bool)

   	infoBubbleContent: A string of content to put in the info bubble (can be full HTML)

      	autoOpenInfo: If the info bubble should be opened immediately or not (bool)

      	directions: An object containing info for providing directions
			showSteps: Whether or not the steps for the directions should be displayed (bool, default: true)
      	    container: The ID of the container to put rendered directions into
      	    from: The starting location for the directions
				- Can be an address, latlng object or 'marker' to use the maps marker loc
      	    to: The ending location for the directions
				- Can be an address, latlng object or 'marker' to use the maps marker loc
      	    travelMode: The travel mode to pass when getting directions (default 'driving')
 				- Types: driving | walking | biking
      	
   	data: Nothing should be passed as 'data' into this plugin. This area of the settings is
 			used to store objects such as the map and geocoder.


	Methods:
		- getMap: Get the map object with all of the settings

		- marker: Set up the marker with the map settings

		- markerClick: Marker click action, by default opens the info bubble (if there is one)
						and looks for callback

		- infoBubble: Set up the info bubble

		- getDirections({ from:'address', to:'address' }): Get directions from/to somewhere
